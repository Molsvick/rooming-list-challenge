---

### Problem Description

When the "Filters" modal is opened on the 'Rooming List Management: Events' page, the 'Closed' 
filter option is unexpectedly pre-selected by default.

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Go to the application's initial page (Rooming List Management: Events).
2.  Click the "Filters" button next to the search bar.
3.  Observe the displayed filter modal.

---

### Expected Behavior

Upon opening the filter modal, all filter checkboxes ('Active', 'Closed', 'Cancelled') should be 
**unchecked** by default, allowing the user to make a fresh selection.

---

### Actual Behavior (Bug)

The 'Closed' filter checkbox is found to be **checked** by default when the filter modal opens, 
as shown in the attached screenshot.

---

### Evidence (Screenshots / Videos / Logs)

* **Screenshot:** See attached file "CheckDefault.png" which highlights the pre-selected 
'Closed' checkbox.

---

### Additional Information

* **Environment:**
    * **Browser/Version:** Firefox and Chrome
    * **Operating System:** [Windows 10]
    * **Device:** Desktop
    * **Affected URL/Endpoint:** [`http://localhost:3000`]
* **Application Version/Build:** [e.g., v1.0.0, dev build]
* **Notes/Context:** This behavior deviates from standard UI expectations where filter options are typically unselected by default 
to avoid unintended filtering. It requires an extra click from the user to reset.

[The filter is not saved]
[Description]
**Filter selections are not persisted upon re-opening filter modal.**

**Bug ID:** [02]
**Reported by:** [Santiago Lloret]
**Date Reported:** 2025-07-14
**Priority:** (Select one)
    [ ] Critical - Blocks essential functionality.
    [x] High - Impacts significantly core functionality, as filter settings aren't retained.
    [ ] Medium - Affects secondary features or is a noticeable aesthetic issue.
    [ ] Low - Minor aesthetic issue, minor usability problem, or enhancement.
**Severity:** (Select one)
    [ ] Blocker - Impedes continuation of work or use of the application.
    [ ] Critical - Data loss, severe security flaw, key functionality not working.
    [x] Major - Important functionality (filtering) does not meet requirements.
    [ ] Minor - Small, but annoying problem.
    [ ] Trivial - Typos, minor aesthetic issues.

---

### Problem Description

After making selections in the filter modal and saving them, the chosen filter options are not retained 
when the filter modal is re-opened. The checkboxes revert to their initial default state.

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Go to the application's initial "Rooming List Management: Events" page.
2.  Click the "Filters" button to open the filter modal.
3.  Modify the filter selections (e.g., uncheck 'Closed' and check 'Cancelled').
4.  Click the "Save" button to apply the changes and close the modal.
5.  Re-open the filter modal by clicking the "Filters" button again.
6.  Observe the state of the checkboxes in the modal.

---

### Expected Behavior

Upon re-opening the filter modal, the previously selected filter options 
(e.g., 'Cancelled' checked, 'Closed' unchecked) should **remain selected**, 
reflecting the last saved state. The list of events on the main page should also remain filtered by these selections.

---

### Actual Behavior (Bug)

When the filter modal is re-opened, the filter checkboxes revert to their **initial default state** 
(e.g., 'Closed' is checked, 'Active' and 'Cancelled' are unchecked), despite having saved different selections 
previously. The main event list might appear correctly filtered, but the modal itself does not reflect the applied filters.

---

### Evidence (Screenshots / Videos / Logs)

* **Gif:** See attached file "FilterSaveError.gif" which shows the filter without saving previous checks.

---

### Additional Information

* **Environment:**
    * **Browser/Version:** Firefox and Chrome
    * **Operating System:** [Windows 10]
    * **Device:** Desktop
    * **Affected URL/Endpoint:** [`http://localhost:3000`]
* **Application Version/Build:** [e.g., v1.0.0, dev build]
* **Notes/Context:** This bug impacts user experience and requires users to re-apply filter selections every time 
they want to adjust filters or verify their current settings. While the list might *appear* filtered, the UI feedback 
in the modal is incorrect. This is different from the bug where 'Closed' is initially selected by default (a separate issue).

[Spacing in Filter modal]
[Description]
**Filter Modal has excessive vertical spacing from "Filters" button.**

**Bug ID:** [03]
**Reported by:** [Santiago Lloret]
**Date Reported:** 2025-07-14
**Priority:** (Select one)
    [ ] Critical - Blocks essential functionality.
    [ ] High - Impacts significantly core functionality.
    [x] Medium - Affects secondary features or is a noticeable aesthetic issue.
    [ ] Low - Minor aesthetic issue, minor usability problem, or enhancement.
**Severity:** (Select one)
    [ ] Blocker - Impedes continuation of work or use of the application.

    [ ] Major - Important functionality does not meet requirements.
    [x] Minor - Small, but annoying problem.
    [ ] Trivial - Typos, minor aesthetic issues.

---

### Problem Description

The filter modal, when opened, appears with a noticeable and excessive vertical gap between its 
top edge and the bottom edge of the "Filters" button.

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Go to the application's initial "Rooming List Management: Events" page.
2.  Click the "Filters" button next to the search bar.
3.  Observe the vertical positioning of the opened filter modal relative to the "Filters" button.

---

### Expected Behavior

The filter modal should appear directly adjacent to or with minimal, intended spacing (e.g., 8-12px) 
below the "Filters" button, aligning closely to indicate its contextual relationship with the button.

---

### Actual Behavior (Bug)

As shown in the attached screenshot, the filter modal is positioned significantly further down from the 
"Filters" button than expected, creating an unappealing visual gap.

---

### Evidence (Screenshots / Videos / Logs)

* **Screenshot:** See attached file "modalSpace.png" which illustrates the large gap between the "Filters" 
button and the filter modal.


---

### Additional Information

* **Environment:**
    * **Browser/Version:** Firefox and Chrome
    * **Operating System:** [Windows 10]
    * **Device:** Desktop
    * **Affected URL/Endpoint:** [`http://localhost:3000`]
* **Application Version/Build:** [e.g., v1.0.0, dev build]
* **Notes/Context:** This is primarily an aesthetic and minor usability issue. It might be related to incorrect 
CSS `margin`, `padding`, or `position` values on either the button or the modal elements. It does not block functionality 
but impacts the overall polish of the UI.

[Wrong scroll indicator behaviour]
[Description]
**Horizontal scroll indicator dots misalign or behave inconsistently with current page.**

**Bug ID:** [04]
**Reported by:** [Santiago Lloret]
**Date Reported:** 2025-07-14
**Priority:** (Select one)
    [ ] Critical - Blocks essential functionality.
    [ ] High - Impacts significantly core functionality, as filter settings aren't retained.
    [x] Medium - Affects secondary features or is a noticeable aesthetic issue.
    [ ] Low - Minor aesthetic issue, minor usability problem, or enhancement.
**Severity:** (Select one)
    [ ] Blocker - Impedes continuation of work or use of the application.
    [ ] Critical - Data loss, severe security flaw, key functionality not working.
    [ ] Major - Important functionality (filtering) does not meet requirements.
    [x] Minor - Small, but annoying problem.
    [ ] Trivial - Typos, minor aesthetic issues.

---

### Problem Description

The visual indicator dots (or "pages") on the horizontal scroll bar for event card groups do not consistently 
align or accurately represent the current "page" or position within the scrolled content, especially when there 
are more than four pages/sections of event cards.

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Go to the application's initial "Rooming List Management: Events" page.
2.  Locate an event group with multiple horizontal "pages" of event cards (e.g., "Austin City Limits").
3.  Click the right navigation arrow (scroll button) for this group **four times** consecutively to navigate through the event card "pages."
4.  Observe the behavior and alignment of the scroll indicator dots at the bottom of the event card section.

---

### Expected Behavior

The scroll indicator bar should accurately reflect the current position or "page" of the horizontal scroll. The active 
indicator dot should precisely align with and highlight the corresponding white space or segment representing the currently 
viewed set of event cards. Each click of the navigation arrow should clearly advance the active indicator to the next segment.

---

### Actual Behavior (Bug)

As demonstrated in the attached screenshot, the active indicator dot (the dark gray segment) on the horizontal scroll bar does not
precisely land on or highlight the white space segment representative of the current "page" of event cards. Its movement appears
istent or misaligned, making it difficult for the user to understand their current position within the scrolled content.

---

### Evidence (Screenshots / Videos / Logs)

* **Screenshot:** See attached file "wrongBarBehaviour.png" which shows the misaligned active indicator dot on the horizontal 
scroll bar, failing to land cleanly on one of the white segments.


---

### Additional Information

* **Environment:**
    * **Browser/Version:** Firefox and Chrome
    * **Operating System:** [Windows 10]
    * **Device:** Desktop
    * **Affected URL/Endpoint:** [`http://localhost:3000`]
* **Application Version/Build:** [e.g., v1.0.0, dev build]
* **Notes/Context:** This bug is primarily an aesthetic and usability issue. It doesn't block core functionality, but it degrades 
the user experience by providing confusing visual feedback regarding navigation progress. It might be related to incorrect calculations 
for scroll position mapping to indicator segments, or issues with the indicator's CSS positioning/animation.

[Wrong search behaviour]
**Non-existent search query breaks page, displays "No rooming lists found" with "Import Data" prompt.**

**Bug ID:** [05]
**Reported by:** [Santiago Lloret]
**Date Reported:** 2025-07-14
**Priority:** (Select one)
    [x] Critical - Blocks essential functionality.
    [ ] High - Impacts significantly core functionality.
    [ ] Medium - Affects secondary features or is a noticeable aesthetic issue.
    [ ] Low - Minor aesthetic issue, minor usability problem, or enhancement.
**Severity:** (Select one)
    [x] Blocker - Impedes continuation of work or use of the application, requiring page reload.
    [ ] Critical - Data loss, severe security flaw, key functionality not working.
    [ ] Major - Important functionality does not meet requirements.
    [ ] Minor - Small, but annoying problem.
    [ ] Trivial - Typos, minor aesthetic issues.

---

### Problem Description

When a search query yields no results, the application displays a "No rooming lists found" message along 
with an "Import Data" button, as if the application started with no data. This incorrect 
state forces the user to manually refresh the page to regain normal search functionality.

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Go to the application's initial "Rooming List Management: Events" page.
2.  In the search input field, type a non-existent search term (e.g., 'zzzzz').
3.  Press Enter or wait for the search to execute.
4.  Observe the page content.

---

### Expected Behavior

When a search query yields no results, the application should:
* Display a clear "No results found" message (e.g., "No events match your search criteria").
* Keep the search bar visible and functional.
* Allow the user to modify the search query or clear it to return to the full list of events without needing a page reload.
* **Should NOT** display an "Import Data" prompt, as this is irrelevant to a search with no results and misrepresents the application's data state.

---

### Actual Behavior (Bug)

As shown in the attached screenshot, instead of a "no results" message specific to the search, the page effectively 
"breaks" by displaying the initial "No rooming lists found" screen with an "Import Data" button. This indicates a loss 
of the current application state, making it impossible to perform new searches or interact with filters without manually 
refreshing the browser.

---

### Evidence (Screenshots / Videos / Logs)

* **Gif:** See attached file "wrongSearch.gif" which displays the "No rooming lists found" message and "Import Data" button after a non-existent search.



---

### Additional Information

* **Environment:**
    * **Browser/Version:** Firefox and Chrome
    * **Operating System:** [Windows 10]
    * **Device:** Desktop
    * **Affected URL/Endpoint:** [`http://localhost:3000`]
* **Application Version/Build:** [e.g., v1.0.0, dev build]
* **Notes/Context:** This is a critical usability defect. Users cannot recover from a "no results" search without a hard 
refresh, severely impacting the search feature's reliability and overall user experience. It suggests that the application's 
state management or routing might be flawed when handling empty search results.
